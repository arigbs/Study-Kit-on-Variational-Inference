### ðŸ’» Scripts

The `ScriptsFromTutorials/` directory contains all the Python scripts that accompany the tutorials. Each script is a hands-on implementation of the concepts discussed.

*   `Tutorial_01_mnist_foundation.py`: Setting up the basics with the MNIST dataset.
*   `Tutorial_02_architecture_experimentation.py`: Exploring and experimenting with different model architectures.
*   `Tutorial_03_cnn_implementation.py`: Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
*   `Tutorial_04_feature_extraction_convolution.py`: Understanding feature extraction using convolutions.
*   `Tutorial_05_basic_autoencoder.py`: Building a fundamental autoencoder.
*   `Tutorial_06_denoising_autoencoders.py`: Creating autoencoders that can reconstruct clean images from noisy input.
*   `Tutorial_07_latent_space_exploration.py`: Diving into and visualizing the latent space of generative models.
*   `Tutorial_08_vae_mathematical_components.py`: A deep dive into the mathematical components of Variational Autoencoders.
*   `Tutorial_09_complete_vae_implementation.py`: A complete, end-to-end implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

### ðŸ“Š Example Visualizations

The `Example_Visualizations/` directory contains a rich collection of images and plots generated from the tutorials. These are crucial for understanding:
*   Model accuracy and loss over time.
*   Feature maps from convolutional layers.
