# Study Kit on Variational Inference

A comprehensive study kit for learning about Variational Inference, includes TensorFlow tutorials, practical examples and exercises, and a glossary on generative models. This collection of resources is designed to help kickstart your journey into the concepts and development of generative models.

## What's Inside

This repository is structured to provide a complete learning experience, from foundational concepts to practical implementation.

### 📚 Tutorials and Guides

*   **`Tensorflow_Tutorials_For_Variational_Inference.html`**: The core of this study kit. This is a series of in-depth tutorials covering Variational Inference from the ground up using TensorFlow.
*   **`QuickStart_Guide_For_Variational_Inference.html`**: A quick guide to get you started with the key concepts of Variational Inference.
*   **`Tutorial_08_Companion_Guide_A_Dialogic_Journey.html`**: A special companion for Tutorial 8, presented in a unique dialogic format to make complex mathematical topics more accessible and intuitive.

### 💻 Scripts

The `ScriptsFromTutorials/` directory contains all the Python scripts that accompany the tutorials. Each script is a hands-on implementation of the concepts discussed.

*   `Tutorial_01_mnist_foundation.py`: Setting up the basics with the MNIST dataset.
*   `Tutorial_02_architecture_experimentation.py`: Exploring and experimenting with different model architectures.
*   `Tutorial_03_cnn_implementation.py`: Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
*   `Tutorial_04_feature_extraction_convolution.py`: Understanding feature extraction using convolutions.
*   `Tutorial_05_basic_autoencoder.py`: Building a fundamental autoencoder.
*   `Tutorial_06_denoising_autoencoders.py`: Creating autoencoders that can reconstruct clean images from noisy input.
*   `Tutorial_07_latent_space_exploration.py`: Diving into and visualizing the latent space of generative models.
*   `Tutorial_08_vae_mathematical_components.py`: A deep dive into the mathematical components of Variational Autoencoders.
*   `Tutorial_09_complete_vae_implementation.py`: A complete, end-to-end implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

### 📊 Example Visualizations

The `Example_Visualizations/` directory contains a rich collection of images and plots generated from the tutorials. These are crucial for understanding:
*   Model accuracy and loss over time.
*   Feature maps from convolutional layers.
*   Image reconstructions from autoencoders.
*   Interpolations and arithmetic in the latent space.
*   The quality of generated samples.
